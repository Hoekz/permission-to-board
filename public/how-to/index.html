        <h1>How to play <u>Permission to Board</u></h1>
        <h2>Playing Together</h2>
        <h3>Create the Game</h3>
        <p>
            You can create a game by choosing the 'Create New Game' button on the main page. This will
            allow you to choose your token color and then provides you with a game key that you
            can share with the other players.
        </p>
        <h3>Display the Game</h3>
        <p>
            For a better experience, Permission to Board provides a way to show the game state on a
            larger screen that shows the routes played, the current scores, active player, and the
            deck. Additionally, the game key is displayed so that others can simply look at the shared
            screen to join. This mode can be activated using the 'Host Existing Game' button and
            entering the game key.
        </p>
        <h3>Join the Game</h3>
        <p>
            Once a game has been created, other players can join on their devices by selecting the
            'Join Existing Game' button and entering the game key. They will need to wait for the creator
            of the game to start play.
        </p>
        <h2>Playing Separate</h2>
        <p>
            Be sure to distribute the game key to all those who want to play!
        </p>
        <p>
            The only real difference when playing separate is that anyone who wants
            to have a separate display view of the board will want to do so themselves.
        </p>
        <h2>Game Rules</h2>
        <p>
            The order of players is randomly determined and you will receive an indicator on your screen
            when it is your turn.
        </p>
        <h3>
            First Turn
        </h3>
        <p>
            The first turn of every player is to select 2 or 3 of the presented route cards. Your task will
            be to connect the 2 cities listed with your trains. If you do so, at the end of the game you will
            be rewarded the amount of points on the card. If you do not, <b>You will lose the amount of points on the card.</b>
        </p>
        <h3>On Your Turn</h3>
        <p>On your turn, you may perform one of the following actions:</p>
        <h4>Take 2 Train Cards</h4>
        <p>
            You can take 2 Train cards, either face up or from the draw pile.
            You may not choose a revealed Rainbow Train card when choosing 2 cards.
        </p>
        <h4>Take a Rainbow Train</h4>
        <p>
            If a Rainbow Train card has been revealed in the 5 face up Train cards, you may take it as your turn.
            <b>If at any point 3 Rainbow Train cards have been revealed, the displayed cards are discarded and redealt.</b>
        </p>
        <h4>Play a Route</h4>
        <p>
            You may choose a route from the map by tapping it, which will reveal the requirements for playing that route.
            If you have enough Train cards (either of the single color needed or the color needed plus Rainbow Train cards)
            you may play the route. <b>Gray routes may be played with any single color.</b> If there are parallel routes
            between 2 cities, you cannot play both of them.
        </p>
        <h4>Take More Route Cards</h4>
        <p>
            In the event that you want to earn more points at the end of the game, you may take more route cards. You can
            do this by viewing your routes and selecting the plus sign. This will present you with 3 new routes to choose
            from. <b>You must choose at least 1 one of the new routes.</b>
        </p>
        <h3>Scoring</h3>
        <p>There are 3 ways to score: Playing trains, completing routes, and having the longest continuous train.</p>
        <p>Each time you play a route between 2 cities, you will be given points based off the length of the train:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 Train - 1 Point</li>
            <li>2 Trains - 2 Points</li>
            <li>3 Trains - 4 Points</li>
            <li>4 Trains - 7 Point</li>
            <li>5 Trains - 10 Points</li>
            <li>6 Trains - 15 Points</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The player(s) at the end of the game with the longest continuous train will be rewarded 10 bonus points.</p>
